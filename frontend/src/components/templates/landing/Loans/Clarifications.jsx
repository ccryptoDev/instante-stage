              times, our disbursement options, and when loan funds may become
              available for your use. Generally, business days means Monday
              through Friday, and we do not fund loans via ACH on federal
              holidays or weekends. If you selected wire transfer or direct
              deposit and have a valid account at a qualifying bank, same
              business-day funding may be available. We do not charge a fee to
              disburse funds by ACH, but your bank may assess a fee. Consult
              with your bank on their fee schedules and posting requirements. If
              you selected funding by check, your loan proceeds will be
              delivered by regular mail through the U.S. postal system. You
              should allow 7 to 10 days for delivery of the loan proceeds.
